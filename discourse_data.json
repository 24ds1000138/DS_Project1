    "answer": "@24ds2000125 @22f3000585 I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues. But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards",

    "question": "Reply 2: Concerns Regarding Various Issues: Graded Assignments, Project Doubts, and ROE Score Updates - Courses / Tools in Data Science - IITM-DSA",
    "answer": "lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards",

    "answer": "It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards",

    "answer": "Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP. Kind regards",

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team",

    "answer": ", This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards",

    "question": "Reply 1: Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python - Courses / Tools in Data Science - IITM-DSA",
    "answer": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards",

    "answer": "The code in autolysis.py has to be dynamic. In other words when you give it goodreads.csv, it should create the goodreads folder. These things should not be hard coded. So therefore when we give it somerandom.csv your autolysis file should create somerandom folder with the required outputs.",

    "answer": "Please refer to the above response. That is the official position. That being said, the evaluation script is a little forgiving. It searches all the relative locations for your files. Still you should follow the official guidelines (because the evaluation script is just a guide and was provided due to popular request. It is however constantly being updated and debugged). If you follow the guidelines you will be safe because even if the script is wrong you have a basis for an appeal. However if you do not follow the published guidelines and write your code to the quirks of the script then you will have no basis for an appeal if the script is corrected to adhere to the guidelines. Think about this. Most students do not look at the script or read these discourse posts. So they will be following the guidelines (which is the minimum we expect). So therefore my advice has always remained consistent. Follow the guidelines. Hope that gives clarity. Any goof ups on our end then resolves in your favour. Kind regards",

It makes no sense to release week 7 before week 6GA so that’s why neither have been pushed to the portal. 1/3rd of the repos did not receive sufficient reviews.

The method to find the closest answer is to find the absolute difference between the option and your calculation. That choice will be the correct one.

    "answer": ", Peers will focus on the 3 bullet points. An explanation of how you scraped the data The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis Everything you provide as support for the 3 bullet points is upto the peers whether to consider in their evaluation. The bullet points will be in the README.md The process is about how you scraped, how you obtained the result and how did you formulate the recommendation. (So in effect it involves all 3 bullet points) The results are a combination of the facts and your recommendation. Sometimes a fact might lead to an erroneous recommendation due to mistakes in process. So results cannot be considered in isolation of point 2 or point 3. Its an amalgam of the two (at least that is my understanding). In other words there is not a clear distinction. The three bullet points will be evaluated wholistically to answer the questions of ranking PROCESS and RESULTS. Hope that helped. Nice that you are thinking about this carefully Most people just do the analytical part and forget the most important bit: communicating something useful. Kind regards,",

Which also means there can be no NaNs in those columns. Everything must be either true or false. Once the csv files are corrected the repo needs to be updated in the submission. Q13 is regression of followers on word count. Make sure the correct columns are assigned for x and y values. Because you will get very different results depending on what you choose as the dependent value and the independent value. Kind regards",

    "answer": "Dear Anju, I have checked both questions, and I am getting the answer that is within the provided range. GA3 is challenging. If I may be completely candid, it looks like an answer spat out by GPT. For example there is a meaningless operation match = pattern.match (line) Why? what’s wrong with just line ? (assuming logs are an array of lines) Did you try to examine the output of a few samples of each match to see if you are actually getting the expected output at each stage of the regex? It might be that your regex is not performing as expected and filtering out the wrong lines. Regex is a tough and unforgiving tool to debug. I will show how to solve this in the live TA session, and I will show a much simpler method that is humanly easily verifiable. From the movie Maverick Topgun… The end is inevitable, Maverick. Your kind is headed for extinction. jjaevdoscwpb1 2034×1203 322 KB Someday GPT will relegate such skills obsolete… But until that day… Yours truly, TDS TA PS: Moral of the story is its okay to use GPT. In fact we encourage it (it is the future), but please try to do some basic debugging and checks first. Use GPT in a progressive step wise fashion so that you can verifiably solve the problem. I am here to guide you on your TDS journey. I will not be able to debug GPT’s code all the time because, lets face it. GPT knows a lot more than me. It just does not have “brains”. So sometimes you need to think about what is actually happening instead of completely treating it as a magic black box. Cheers!",

    "answer": ", Could you share the question, as it is parameterised for all students. Also typically if you are getting several questions wrong, then its far more likely that the logic you have employed has errors. I have looked at your code and presumed that it is /hindimp3/ and Tuesday. I do get the correct answer in the range you provided. Also if you wanted help with code, it is not practical to debug your code when you share screen shots. It is far more kinder (indeed almost a prerequisite for code that is more than a couple of lines) to those who might help you to actually encapsulate your code in block quotes. A good example of how to ask help, is like how this fellow student has demonstrated: Doubt GA-1 Tools in Data Science Quiz id: e23cf3e74cea4b56a217372fafc75228  In Q-3, Every time I am getting different when I hit the link for collab notebook to fix the code and get back to the page light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.246)  this value '0.246' is changing every time that means window is reloading every time so I am sure answers of my last two question would be change also then what to do in that case  import numpy as np from PIL import Image from google.colab import files import colorsys  # There is a mistake in… You are likely to get much more help if you do so.

    "answer": "Network analysis is used in climate modeling to study complex interactions and relationships within the climate system. It allows researchers to understand how different components of the climate system (e.g., temperature, precipitation, atmospheric circulation) are interconnected. Here are some ways network analysis is applied in climate modeling: Spatio-temporal network analysis for studying climate patterns | Climate Dynamics (2014) ENSO in CMIP5 simulations: network connectivity from the recent past to the twenty-third century | Climate Dynamics (2014) Climate Networks: Climate data (such as temperature or pressure) from different geographical locations can be represented as a network. In this network, nodes represent locations, and edges represent correlations or interactions between climate variables at these locations. This approach helps in identifying key regions that influence global climate patterns. Networks of climate change: connecting causes and consequences | Applied Network Science | Full Text Teleconnections: Network analysis is used to study teleconnections, which are long-distance relationships between climate variables (like the El Niño Southern Oscillation or the North Atlantic Oscillation). By analyzing these networks, researchers can detect how changes in one part of the world affect other regions. Extreme Event Prediction: Networks help in identifying how extreme weather events, like heat waves or storms, propagate through the system. By mapping these events in a network, it becomes easier to predict areas at risk or potential future events based on past occurrences. Climate network analysis helps pinpoint regions at higher risk of extreme weather | ScienceDaily Feedback Loops: Network analysis is useful for identifying feedback loops in the climate system, where changes in one variable influence another, which in turn feeds back into the original variable. For example, melting ice reduces the Earth’s albedo, leading to more warming, which further accelerates ice melt. etc. etc. etc. If you still feel Climate modeling is a “niche” application of network analysis, you can ask the instructors for second consideration.

The improper use of charts does not mean that they are the appropriate tool for the job. Hence for this question the correct answer is categorical data. People in the statistics department (and the business department) take particular umbrage to the improper use of graphs. It’s one of their pet peeves. A good analogy is that we can use a spanner to hit a nail. Does not mean its the best tool to hit a nail. In this question it does use the qualifier best and its hard to argue for other choices when categorical data is one of the choices, because that is in fact the best use of a bar chart.",

GA6, P1, P2, GA4 scoring for individual answers will be pushed by tomorrow morning. GA 6.2 an 6.3 solution is pair wise distance between two locations. You have to count the pairs less than the parameterised distance. The GA itself has the wrong answer key, but we do have the submissions of all students. Typically the right answer was within ±1 of the answers shown. If thats the case you will be awarded the mark, if you selected the right answer. If the correct answer was outside the range displayed you will be awarded the mark as well. (see point 2) Hope that gives some clarity. Kind regards",

    "question": "Reply 1: Request for Regular TA Sessions - Courses / Tools in Data Science - IITM-DSA",
    "answer": "Hi, As there were no new content releases for the past couple of weeks, and TDS has no quizzes, we did have sessions but the content was so sparse that we decided against recording it. They were mostly quick overviews and doubt clearing sessions. We will conduct a more rigorous treatment of the subject material with a view of preparing students for the exam closer to end term. Kind regards",
